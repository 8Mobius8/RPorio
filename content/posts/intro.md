So I thought it would be good to have some sort of journal on    
this project to here it's. Using [Hugo](hugo.io) to make a silly 
website as a blog and possibly wiki for this thing call RPGorio.

So what is *RPGorio* and is it a good idea? As of writting *RPGorio* does not 
exist yet, but hopefully one day it will be a fun Factorio role playing mod!

> Question: 'But Mobius... why does Factorio need and RP elements?' 

It really doesn't. It's a great factory/rocket-launching/genociding/nature-destorying/automating
game does not need anything else. *But* when you are in love with a game you tend
to want to add to it to make it even more interesting! In my case it might be making
it worse. Idk. It's part of the fun in making the mod!

> Question: 'Ah so you just want to make this thing because you're a super factorio nerd

and have sent thousands of rockets to space.'
HA-ha! No, actually haven't deployed more than an handful of rockets. I just excited
to try to make a *serious* factorio mod! I want to add something challenging and
fun! And mainly because my friends and I didn't like the existing RP mods.

> Question: 'Another RPG mod? ðŸ˜’ really? 

I understand the sentiment. There are plenty of [good ones out there](https://mods.factorio.com/query/rpg)
all of which are entertaining and fun, but not really what I wanted.

> Question?: 'Not good enough eh?! EXPLAIN!'

What I mean by 'not really what I wanted' I mean to say most of them do not really
related to the factory/rocket-launching/genociding/nature-destorying/automating parts
of factorio. Well okay, maybe the genociding and nature destroying, but nothing I 
did help me build my factory. Alot of them are just 'buffing' your character and it's 
great to be able run so fast to run thru walls but I wanted a real reward for gaining
experience to feeds directly into launching that glorious rocket.

> Q: 'Whatever I'll check back in a few months or never.' 

Sounds good to me! I plan on I'll have something to show you when you come back.

As of writting this it's really just an idea percolating in my head and writting 
this post allowed me to start creating my site. 

Anyway... ttfn! See you in the future!
