	<section><p>So I thought it would be good to have some sort of journal on <br>
this project to here it&rsquo;s. Using <a href="hugo.io">Hugo</a> to make a silly
website as a blog and possibly wiki for this thing call RPGorio.</p>
<p>So what is <em>RPGorio</em> and is it a good idea? As of writting <em>RPGorio</em> does not
exist yet, but hopefully one day it will be a fun Factorio role playing mod!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Question: &lsquo;But Mobius&hellip; why does Factorio need and RP elements?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It really doesn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a great factory/rocket-launching/genociding/nature-destorying/automating
game does not need anything else. <em>But</em> when you are in love with a game you tend
to want to add to it to make it even more interesting! In my case it might be making
it worse. Idk. It&rsquo;s part of the fun in making the mod!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Question: &lsquo;Ah so you just want to make this thing because you&rsquo;re a super factorio nerd</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and have sent thousands of rockets to space.&rsquo;
HA-ha! No, actually haven&rsquo;t deployed more than an handful of rockets. I just excited
to try to make a <em>serious</em> factorio mod! I want to add something challenging and
fun! And mainly because my friends and I didn&rsquo;t like the existing RP mods.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Question: &lsquo;Another RPG mod? ðŸ˜’ really?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand the sentiment. There are plenty of <a href="https://mods.factorio.com/query/rpg">good ones out there</a>
all of which are entertaining and fun, but not really what I wanted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Question?: &lsquo;Not good enough eh?! EXPLAIN!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I mean by &lsquo;not really what I wanted&rsquo; I mean to say most of them do not really
related to the factory/rocket-launching/genociding/nature-destorying/automating parts
of factorio. Well okay, maybe the genociding and nature destroying, but nothing I
did help me build my factory. Alot of them are just &lsquo;buffing&rsquo; your character and it&rsquo;s
great to be able run so fast to run thru walls but I wanted a real reward for gaining
experience to feeds directly into launching that glorious rocket.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: &lsquo;Whatever I&rsquo;ll check back in a few months or never.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds good to me! I plan on I&rsquo;ll have something to show you when you come back.</p>
<p>As of writting this it&rsquo;s really just an idea percolating in my head and writting
this post allowed me to start creating my site.</p>
<p>Anyway&hellip; ttfn! See you in the future!</p>
